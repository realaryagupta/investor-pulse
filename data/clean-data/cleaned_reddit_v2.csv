39,your_mortgage_broker,2025-05-14,2011,wallstreetbets,NVDA,this market is disgustingly overpriced and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during dot comglobal financial crisis i want to preface this by stating that i legitimately home someone can refute what i have to say here i take no pleasure in the thought of peoples 401ks and iras and pension funds getting absolutely decimated and this post has nothing to do with politics i think the market has been overpriced for a long time 8 years and it is only getting worse some quick points 1 price to earnings ratio price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy the sp 500 is over 28 today and before the market started correcting in february we were actually over 31 the nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44 while i imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what pe means for those that dont heres a quick summary for purposes of this post lets use nvda as an example assume nvda didnt have a single penny in expenses they didnt have to pay for employees they had no rent there was no salary for jensen huang and they didnt have to pay a penny in taxes they somehow got all their electricity for free and they didnt even have a cogs cost of goods sold somehow they were getting all of their materials for free then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today and they took 100 of that revenue and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company right now nvdas pe is at 4543 meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money the entire sp is trading over 28 today meaning if the 500 largest companies in the usa didnt have a single expense and continued generating the same revenue it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back who in the world would be interested in signing up for that investment opportunity my own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and i wouldnt invest based on that return 2 the buffett indicator the buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the us stock market divided by gdp historically that number has hung out right around 1 meaning the total value of the us stock market should be roughly the same as gdp buffett himself stated a value of 7590 is reasonable and a value over 120 signals the market is overpriced the highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble when it was 21 standard deviations above the trendline the highest until now that is the market value is currently 211 of gdp or almost 70 above what historically has been seen as normal 3 the stock market is insanely top heavy the mag 7 currently account for 31 of the sp 500 and over 40 of the nasdaq if these 7 stocks correct it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole we saw this play out during dot com with the likes of cisco intel and oracle while the market was top heavy then it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today in fact the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when dot com crashed side note but i do think investors have briefly taken note of this so much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that canwill be generated by ai but remember what happened when deepseek emerged last year and alerted wallstreet that an incredibly sophisticated ai can be created without pouring billions of dollars into rd and infrastructure the market absolutely tanked what if it becomes obvious that these ai plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world and that these systems can be developed by any midcap with a decent budget 4 home prices and the housing market i wont dive too deep into this but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in us history based on median us income and median us home price right before the global financial crisismortgage crisis of 0809 this number hit its highest point in us history 45 its highest percent until the last 12 months it now takes over 46 of a familys income to purchase a home 30 is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable the condo market is collapsing particularly in florida where hoa dues and insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable foreclosures on fha loans are also set to resume biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after covid meaning call your servicer say youre experiencing a hardship and they simply give you a deferral none of these homes could be foreclosed upon they then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest this policy still exists today but is about to come to an end in september as of q1 2025 over 106 of all fha mortgages are at least one payment late over 4 of fha mortgages are over 90 days late what happens when fha foreclosures absolutely flood the market what does this do to home prices and even more importantly what does this do to homebuilders if inventory skyrockets more than it already has over the last couple of months and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply will home builders still be able to make money homebuilding employs over 11 million americans plumbers electricians roofers landscapers drywallers framers truck drivers etc when homes stop being built unemployment skyrockets and gdp shrinks dramatically 5 consumer debt is through the roof credit card debt is at the highest its ever been and delinquency rates are as high as theyve been since emerging from the global financial crisis q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high auto loan delinquency rates are the highest theyve been in decades 6 bonds worldwide are pushing higher and higher the us is getting hit here worse than most as it seems people are not excited about trumps game of chicken with tariffs nonetheless you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk interest rates cuts have not quelled this despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year the 10 year tnote is actually up 80 ticks since then 7 commercial real estate a massive amount of commercial realestate will need to be refinanced in the coming 1224 months and you will see these payments skyrocket many holders of commercial realestate refinanced their properties in the quarters after covid when interest rates were incredibly low most of these loans are either done on 5year balloons or as adjustable rate mortgages these owners will see their payments jump by 3050 even 70 as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time this will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models or at least partial work from home models office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed meaning less tenants all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing 8 student loan debt the governments moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end 43 million americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5 years are now going to have to start making payments those that dont will see their credit score be absolutely decimated what other payments will the begin to fall behind on as i mentioned previously credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high and rising how much worse does that get when 15 of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month there is a dozen other items i could list here but in the interest of actually getting some work done today ill leave my

98,fountainheadusa,2025-05-25,7,investing,NVDA,buying puts for a correction last week i sold a few stocks expecting that the sp 500 spx spy was due for a pullbackcorrection since then the spy made a triple top at 59554 on may 20th close to its dec 2024 top of 60907 and feb 19 2025 top of 613 this looks like a triple top unless nvda takes it higher wednesday thursday after earnings the spy closed at 57911 on friday the 23rd almost 3 lower i believe this is the start of a correction which should likely take the spy to around 540 about 10 lower i plan to buy july 31st and august 31st 540 strike price spy puts why am i bearish there are the 4 main reasons 1 the first and foremost reason for the weaknesses in bonds is higher borrowing costs for the us government the 30year treasury yield currently stands at 504 and seems likely to climb as the us congress passes a budget with a running deficit of 124 of gdp which increases the deficit further it also assumes a large amount of customs duties as tariff income and doge costcutting as savings in my opinion both are rosy projections and will probably exacerbate the deficit interest payments have surpassed defence as the largest line item on the governments books the downgrade from moodys will further increase interest rates which will lead to a drop in the stock markets 2 the second is tariffs which will show up in earnings in q2q3 we cant escape them even as tariffs have whittled down to an estimated 15 to 20 on average we shouldnt forget that last year tariffs averaged 34 this is a fourfold increase and will fuel inflation and stagflation and affect corporate bottom lines if theyre not passed on and passing them on to customers would likely lead to a decrease in demand which would still reduce corporate bottom lines there are no easy solutions to tariffs 3 the third is an overpriced sp 500 index which at 5803 yields an earnings yield of $2605803 448 why would you buy a riskyielding asset for 448 when the 10year us treasury offers you 454 the sp 500 is priced at 223 times 2025 earnings higher than the 10year average of 195 besides the 195x multiple was when interest rates averaged closer to 3 simply the risk premium is not enough for me 4 the fourth is the persistent weakness and uncertainty in economic data home sales are one example according to redfin 56000 home purchase contracts fell through in april 2025 or about 14 of sales a level last seen in 2017 existing home sales fell another 2 in april on top of the large drop in march of 5 the largest drop since 2022 pmi readings for services and manufacturing came in at 523 for april a decent number by any standards but with accompanying color stating the obvious detrimental concerns of tariff uncertainties on demand and supply chains tariff uncertainty has led to the largest accumulation of inventories in the last 18 years given this buildup it would only be fair to assume that the next two quarters will not grow as well as q12025 uncertainty on tariffs fridays call for 50 tariffs on the eu and 25 tariffs on iphones not made in the us increases volatility in bond and stock markets other similar arbitrary executive actions such as the revocation of harvard universitys ability to enroll international students can also have economic repercussions currently like so many other cases on immigration and tariffs challenging executive actions this one too is in court which one could lead to a constitutional crisis all of these suggest that bond markets could remain weak for a structural credit risk reason the us never had that problem but i believe it could remain a problem during the trump presidency it already is a bearish indicator in the form of higher borrowing costs from international lenders not willing to lend at lower rates how much longer can buy the dip save the stock market we are ignoring the dangers ahead the cnn greed and fear index has gone from extreme fear to greed in just one month and is flirting with extreme greed in my opinion the fair value of the spy is around 520 or 5200 for the sp 500 based on a pe multiple of 20 x 260 per share 5200 and ill buy puts to hedge my portfolio for the dangers ahead,-0.9819,negative

can always add more on declines the small $ 1 bn beat for q1 results was impressive considering the $ 25 bn in lost h20 sales to china but even more astounding was the reaffirmed guidance of $ 45 bn

nvidia is missing the woods for the trees inferencing demand is a major revenue catalyst for nvidia over the next several years as evidenced by the significant increase in tokenization similarly seen is agentic ai demand which is a revenuebearing product of reasoning and inference and will continue to grow this was jensen huang on the conference call today on inference demand well we would like to serve all of it and i think were on track to serve most of it grace blackwell nvlink72 is the ideal engine today the ideal computer thinking machine if you will for reasoning ai theres a couple of reasons for that the first reason is that the token generation amount the number of tokens reasoning goes through is 100 times 1000 times more than a oneshot chatbot its essentially thinking to itself breaking down a problem stepbystep it might be planning multiple paths to an answer it could be using tools reading pdfs reading web pages watching videos and then producing a result an answer the longer it thinks the better the answer the smarter the answer is and so what we would like to do and the reason why grace blackwell was designed to give such a giant stepup in inference performance is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible compared to hopper grace blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared and so this is going to be a huge huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time oneyear product cadence nvidia has been very proactive when it comes to its product lineup and showed off an ambitious slate of coming products at its annual gtc conference in march including updated versions of its blackwell chips that are in particularly high demand by companies trying to build up stateoftheart ai networks according to the wall street journal analysts expect the blackwell lineup alone to generate nearly $98 billion in sales in the current fiscal year ending in january and a further $119 billion next year and blackwell contributed about 70 of datacenter sales in q126 successfully transitioning from the hopper series i suspect that the $200 bn revenue number for fy 2026 will be short and with all the sovereign and other ai demand it might even be exceeded even without chinese sales with gpu cluster investment announcements from sovereign ai and oracle and xai easily making up for the lost sales accelerated computing is the new paradigm and i can see nvidia dominating in every sphere of accelerated computing from jensen huang on the nvidia earnings call so thats the fundamental reason that was the core driving reason for grace blackwell nvlink72 of course in order to do that we had to reinvent literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built and but now were in full production its going to be exciting its going to be incredibly exciting and so computing is one stack one part of it but remember enterprise it is really three pillars its compute storage and networking and weve now put all three of them together finally and were going to market with that cloud computing was just the start these will follow onpremise computing and pcs nvidia has already announced new products rtx pro enterprise ai server that runs everything onprem dgx spark and dgx station which are going to replace traditional cpurun pcs are designed for developers who want to work onprem enterprise ai is still a very nascent market and could be huge for nvidia a computing system that can integrate and run enterprise ai stacks run enterprise it stacks but add ai to them the networking platform business using nvlink is available for competitors to make advanced gpu clusters physical and industrial ai through the omniverse and robotics jensen huang on the earnings call and then lastly industrial ai remember one of the implications of the world reordering if you will is a regions onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere in addition to ai factories of course there are new electronics manufacturing chip manufacturing being built around the world and all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when omniverse and ai and all the work that were doing with robotics is emerging and so this fourth pillar is quite important every factory will have an ai factory associated with it and in order to create these physical ai systems you really have to train a vast amount of data so back to more data more training more ais to be created more computers and so these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge neoclouds small business ai rentals through neoclouds like coreweave and nebius should be a huge business lost in all this was gaming revenue which grew 42 to $376 billion 33 above analysts forecasts $ 1 bn beat on $278 estimate that is extremely impressive and attributed to blackwells product strengths auto was another

for ai they have two segments i custombuilt highperformance data centers and ii gpus as a service applied is currently focused on a large 400mw data center project in ellendale nd and is marketing a 14gw pipeline of additional capacity please see the companys latest investor presentation on their website for more details there is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and fortune 500 companies covered extensively everywhere you look power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck nvidias ceo jensen has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into ais potential apld is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity aplds history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in lowcost power locations was the perfect preparation for todays ai opportunity aplds foray into north dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power low cost land with space for expansion room for additional windsolar farms to be integrated state tax incentives and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the tco of high density ai data centers a healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers if gpus are the pickaxes behind the ai revolution power guys are swinging the axes unit economics and valuation hpc data centers the rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $812 million per mw to build and each mw can generate $1mm of noi applied digitals ellendale campus has signed 250 mw of 15year leases with coreweave expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years $4667 million per year that works out to $1867 million of revenue per mw per year assuming a typical hpcdata center ebitda margin of 5060 each mw will likely produce $09$12 million of noi per year therefore the 250 mw currently under contract should yield $233$280 million of noi annually at a 56 cap rate that implies an enterprise value tev in the $39$56 billion range for the signed 250 mw if the full 400 mw build is leased at similar economics total noi would be $360$480 million per year implying tev of $6$96 billion the remaining 150 mw of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual noiie another $25$3 billion of tevif signed at comparable rates locking in the 250 mw coreweave lease translates into roughly $33$517b of equity or about $15$23 per share each additional 100 mw of backlog using $09$12 m of noi per mw and a 56 cap rate would be worth approximately $5share using the same math if applied is able to lock in 14gw of projects thats an additional $70share of value that could be created haircut all of this however you prefer the numbers can get wild applied digital cloud this segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently but is an underappreciated lotto ticket think of it as an earlystage coreweave the business model is simple they purchase gpus from nvda install them in data centers and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 23 years the gpus typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term leaving applied digital cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the gpus there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment the nvda investment is especially important for this segment because this is where nvda can drive applieds future success the hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies so it is in nvdas longterm interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their gpus they want companies like applied and coreweave to prosper nvda can assure applieds success in a variety of ways by providing i early allocations of the latest products ii the best customer prospects who want to consume nvdas products as a service and iii capital consider what nvdas support did for coreweave nvda invested $100mm in coreweave in 2023 at a $2bn valuation as of september 2024 coreweave was raising money at a $23bn valuation and look at where they are now valuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started if we assume its worth just 10 of coreweave thats $7bn and it goes up from there in the fullness of time if applied digital cloud prospers then the company will spin this out as a separate company the high level setup based on the recently announced data center lease with coreweave it is clear that apld is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout but despite the recent surge in stock price it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued applied digital will be the only pure play nextgen data center player in the public markets there is no short thesis when nvda and related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a longterm partner and customer apld will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next ai bottleneck the
