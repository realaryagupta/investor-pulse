on a delayed schedule because shanghai through the panama canal to new york city is a longer trip than shanghai to los angels and because of that its a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month largescale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter very little can be done to stop this because even if the tariffs on china were lifted tomorrow it takes weeks to get merchandise from a chinese port to an american retail store plus i feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on china wont be lifted any time soon a natural question when you hear this is if thats true why isnt the stock market down more and i think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as hardly anyone is paid to care i was going to title this post financial professionals mostly arent paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow but the index fund providers are paid to care in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error they are paid to make sure that when the index goes up x the fund captures those games and when the index goes down y the fund doesnt do any worse than that but they arent paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow and this is not a criticism its not their job whos job is it for highfrequency traders its pretty much the opposite of their job their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a pennypershare profit and some of the hate hfts get strikes me as overwrought before hfts were skimming a penny a share off every trade floor traders were skimming cents because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar but hfts definitely dont care about whats going to happen to the trucking industry next month now despite what you may have heard hfts arent the entire stock market hfts like to do small quick trades so instead if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of tsla they might call around to various dealers and ask for quotes the dealers will quote numbers below what an hft would pay for ten shares of tsla but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else and that cant be done in a matter of milliseconds maybe they unwind their position over the course of hours so when the dealer gives a quote they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrowbut they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody elses problem okay but those are the middlemen what about professional stockpickers active mutual fund managers longshort hedge fund managers unfortunately they also arent paid to care what the sp will do the day after tomorrow managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark which is generally an index if the index is down thats fine as long as their stocks are down less or perhaps realistically for riskaverse managers arent down significantly more meanwhile a longshort hedge fund which buys some stocks while shorting others wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have no effect whatsoever on the funds performance so yes actively managed mutual funds and longshort hedge funds are going to take a longerterm view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling and yes they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others but even if they start to suspect every company should be down as a result of tariffs theyre not going to smash a big red button labeled sell everything because thats not their job maybe its somebodys job to care but honestly its hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing if you realize a crash is coming but get the timing wrong you could lose a lot of moneylike if you went allin shorting the market in when the dotcom bubble wouldnt burst until the following year and if get the timing of this crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves how does that let you correctly time the next crash its not a lot to build a career on hell its one thing to know about freight schedules another thing to predict when the market will notice it could crash tomorrow on bad firstquarter gdp numbers or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in and i certainly dont claim to know how badly the us will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it which is why my moneys in a mix of international stocks and international bonds rather than simply one or the other what i can tell you is this unfortunately you cant assume surely somebody would do something about it if there were a totally predictable crash incoming nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do act accordingly,-0.9714,negative

101,2016,wallstreetbets,NVDA,2025-05-14,this market is disgustingly overpriced and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during dot comglobal financial crisis i want to preface this by stating that i legitimately home someone can refute what i have to say here i take no pleasure in the thought of peoples ks and iras and pension funds getting absolutely decimated and this post has nothing to do with politics i think the market has been overpriced for a long time years and it is only getting worse some quick points price to earnings ratio price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy the sp is over today and before the market started correcting in february we were actually over the nasdaq is at and was as high as while i imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what pe means for those that dont heres a quick summary for purposes of this post lets use nvda as an example assume nvda didnt have a single penny in expenses they didnt have to pay for employees they had no rent there was no salary for jensen huang and they didnt have to pay a penny in taxes they somehow got all their electricity for free and they didnt even have a cogs cost of goods sold somehow they were getting all of their materials for free then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today and they took of that revenue and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company right now nvdas pe is at meaning it would be years before investors recouped their money the entire sp is trading over today meaning if the largest companies in the usa didnt have a single expense and continued generating the same revenue it would take years for investors to get their money back who in the world would be interested in signing up for that investment opportunity my own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and i wouldnt invest based on that return the buffett indicator the buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the us stock market divided by gdp historically that number has hung out right around meaning the total value of the us stock market should be roughly the same as gdp buffett himself stated a value of is reasonable and a value over signals the market is overpriced the highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble when it was standard deviations above the trendline the highest until now that is the market value is currently of gdp or almost above what historically has been seen as normal the stock market is insanely top heavy the mag currently account for of the sp and over of the nasdaq if these stocks correct it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole we saw this play out during dot com with the likes of cisco intel and oracle while the market was top heavy then it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today in fact the top most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top did when dot com crashed side note but i do think investors have briefly taken note of this so much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that canwill be generated by ai but remember what happened when deepseek emerged last year and alerted wallstreet that an incredibly sophisticated ai can be created without pouring billions of dollars into rd and infrastructure the market absolutely tanked what if it becomes obvious that these ai plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world and that these systems can be developed by any midcap with a decent budget home prices and the housing market i wont dive too deep into this but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in us history based on median us income and median us home price right before the global financial crisismortgage crisis of this number hit its highest point in us history its highest percent until the last months it now takes over of a familys income to purchase a home is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable the condo market is collapsing particularly in florida where hoa dues and insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable foreclosures on fha loans are also set to resume biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after covid meaning call your servicer say youre experiencing a hardship and they simply give you a deferral none of these homes could be foreclosed upon they then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest this policy still exists today but is about to come to an end in september as of q over of all fha mortgages are at least one payment late over of fha mortgages are over days late what happens when fha foreclosures absolutely flood the market what does this do to home prices and even more importantly what does this do to homebuilders if inventory skyrockets more than it already has over the last couple of months and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply will home builders still be able to make money homebuilding employs over million americans plumbers electricians roofers landscapers drywallers framers truck drivers etc when homes stop being built unemployment skyrockets and gdp shrinks dramatically consumer debt is through the roof credit card debt is at the highest its ever been and delinquency rates are as high as theyve been since emerging from the global financial crisis q of was the last time delinquency rates were this high auto loan delinquency rates are the highest theyve been in decades bonds worldwide are pushing higher and higher the us is getting hit here worse than most as it seems people are not excited about trumps game of chicken with tariffs nonetheless you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk interest rates cuts have not quelled this despite bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year the year tnote is actually up ticks since then commercial real estate a massive amount of commercial realestate will need to be refinanced in the coming months and you will see these payments skyrocket many holders of commercial realestate refinanced their properties in the quarters after covid when interest rates were incredibly low most of these loans are either done on year balloons or as adjustable rate mortgages these owners will see their payments jump by even as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time this will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models or at least partial work from home models office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed meaning less tenants all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing student loan debt the governments moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end million americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of k in student loan debt for the last years are now going to have to start making payments those that dont will see their credit score be absolutely decimated what other payments will the begin to fall behind on as i mentioned previously credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high and rising how much worse does that get when of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month there is a dozen other items i could list here but in the interest of actually getting some

126,0,stocks,NVDA,2025-05-29,we should never have doubted you jensen i had mentioned yesterday that i wasnt going to hedge nvidias q earnings ignore the noise and stay invested for the long term now im kicking myself for not buying more when it was nonetheless i plan to add more paying extra for a stock i expect to reach over in the next three years is ok and i can always add more on declines the small bn beat for q results was impressive considering the bn in lost h sales to china but even more astounding was the reaffirmed guidance of bn for q in spite of bn in h lost sales in q one can imagine where the stock would have skyrocketed if guidance had come in at bn instead of bn trying to thread the needle and trade nvidia is missing the woods for the trees inferencing demand is a major revenue catalyst for nvidia over the next several years as evidenced by the significant increase in tokenization similarly seen is agentic ai demand which is a revenuebearing product of reasoning and inference and will continue to grow this was jensen huang on the conference call today on inference demand well we would like to serve all of it and i think were on track to serve most of it grace blackwell nvlink is the ideal engine today the ideal computer thinking machine if you will for reasoning ai theres a couple of reasons for that the first reason is that the token generation amount the number of tokens reasoning goes through is times times more than a oneshot chatbot its essentially thinking to itself breaking down a problem stepbystep it might be planning multiple paths to an answer it could be using tools reading pdfs reading web pages watching videos and then producing a result an answer the longer it thinks the better the answer the smarter the answer is and so what we would like to do and the reason why grace blackwell was designed to give such a giant stepup in inference performance is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible compared to hopper grace blackwell is some times higher speed and throughput compared and so this is going to be a huge huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time oneyear product cadence nvidia has been very proactive when it comes to its product lineup and showed off an ambitious slate of coming products at its annual gtc conference in march including updated versions of its blackwell chips that are in particularly high demand by companies trying to build up stateoftheart ai networks according to the wall street journal analysts expect the blackwell lineup alone to generate nearly billion in sales in the current fiscal year ending in january and a further billion next year and blackwell contributed about of datacenter sales in q successfully transitioning from the hopper series i suspect that the bn revenue number for fy will be short and with all the sovereign and other ai demand it might even be exceeded even without chinese sales with gpu cluster investment announcements from sovereign ai and oracle and xai easily making up for the lost sales accelerated computing is the new paradigm and i can see nvidia dominating in every sphere of accelerated computing from jensen huang on the nvidia earnings call so thats the fundamental reason that was the core driving reason for grace blackwell nvlink of course in order to do that we had to reinvent literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built and but now were in full production its going to be exciting its going to be incredibly exciting and so computing is one stack one part of it but remember enterprise it is really three pillars its compute storage and networking and weve now put all three of them together finally and were going to market with that cloud computing was just the start these will follow onpremise computing and pcs nvidia has already announced new products rtx pro enterprise ai server that runs everything onprem dgx spark and dgx station which are going to replace traditional cpurun pcs are designed for developers who want to work onprem enterprise ai is still a very nascent market and could be huge for nvidia a computing system that can integrate and run enterprise ai stacks run enterprise it stacks but add ai to them the networking platform business using nvlink is available for competitors to make advanced gpu clusters physical and industrial ai through the omniverse and robotics jensen huang on the earnings call and then lastly industrial ai remember one of the implications of the world reordering if you will is a regions onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere in addition to ai factories of course there are new electronics manufacturing chip manufacturing being built around the world and all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when omniverse and ai and all the work that were doing with robotics is emerging and so this fourth pillar is quite important every factory will have an ai factory associated with it and in order to create these physical ai systems you really have to train a vast amount of data so back to more data more training more ais to be created more computers and so these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge neoclouds small business ai rentals through neoclouds like coreweave and nebius should be a huge business lost in all this was gaming revenue which grew to billion above analysts forecasts bn beat on estimate that is extremely impressive and attributed to blackwells product strengths auto was another gainer jumping to mn up yoy i believe were in just the nd innings of a innings ai revolution and my year target for nvidia is
