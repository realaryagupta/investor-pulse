0,122,investing,TSLA,tsla why im still bullish despite the eps nosedive been holding tsla since and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings while everyones freaking out about the eps drop ive been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up over the same period either im missing something or the market is my position shares average up about total the q earnings were objectively bad eps of vs expected missed by factory changeovers for model y killed production numbers automotive margins down to from previous highs in the mids musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call yet im still holding and even added shares on the postearnings dip heres why the energy business is quietly becoming a monster while everyone obsesses over car deliveries teslas energy storage business hit record gross profit with margins my brother works in commercial solar and he says megapack orders are backlogged for months the margins here are substantially better than automotive and its growing faster source the robotaxi bet could pay off big i was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until i saw the austin test videos if they actually launch paid rides next month as planned it changes everything about the valuation model even if its limited geographically proving the technology works would be massive optimus robot could be the sleeper hit the optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform teslas business model theyre planning to have thousands of units in production by yearend ramping to potentially a million units annually by imagine having one of these handling household chores elder care or factory work the addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what theyre promising ive been wrong before but i sold half my position in thinking the twitter acquisition would tank tesla cost me about k in potential gains when it rebounded the lesson i learned was that betting against teslas longterm vision because of shortterm issues has consistently been a losing strategy source that said im not blind to the risks pe of is insane by traditional metrics byd is eating their lunch in china and now europe insider selling has been heavy musk cfo directors the new affordable model keeps getting delayed whats your take am i crazy for holding through this has anyone else noticed the energy business numbers and whats your read on the robotaxi timeline real innovation or more musk hype,-0.7283,negative,2025-05-27,365.2900085449219,367.7099914550781,356.0,358.42999267578125,88545700
1,460,investing,TSLA,financial professionals mostly arent paid to care what happens to the sp the day after tomorrow container volumes at the port of los angels are down this week theyll be down farther next week we know this because arrivals are scheduled in advance and crossing the ocean by boat takes awhile container volumes at east coast ports are expected to do the same thing but on a delayed schedule because shanghai through the panama canal to new york city is a longer trip than shanghai to los angels and because of that its a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month largescale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter very little can be done to stop this because even if the tariffs on china were lifted tomorrow it takes weeks to get merchandise from a chinese port to an american retail store plus i feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on china wont be lifted any time soon a natural question when you hear this is if thats true why isnt the stock market down more and i think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as hardly anyone is paid to care i was going to title this post financial professionals mostly arent paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow but the index fund providers are paid to care in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error they are paid to make sure that when the index goes up x the fund captures those games and when the index goes down y the fund doesnt do any worse than that but they arent paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow and this is not a criticism its not their job whos job is it for highfrequency traders its pretty much the opposite of their job their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a pennypershare profit and some of the hate hfts get strikes me as overwrought before hfts were skimming a penny a share off every trade floor traders were skimming cents because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar but hfts definitely dont care about whats going to happen to the trucking industry next month now despite what you may have heard hfts arent the entire stock market hfts like to do small quick trades so instead if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of tsla they might call around to various dealers and ask for quotes the dealers will quote numbers below what an hft would pay for ten shares of tsla but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else and that cant be done in a matter of milliseconds maybe they unwind their position over the course of hours so when the dealer gives a quote they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrowbut they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody elses problem okay but those are the middlemen what about professional stockpickers active mutual fund managers longshort hedge fund managers unfortunately they also arent paid to care what the sp will do the day after tomorrow managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark which is generally an index if the index is down thats fine as long as their stocks are down less or perhaps realistically for riskaverse managers arent down significantly more meanwhile a longshort hedge fund which buys some stocks while shorting others wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have no effect whatsoever on the funds performance so yes actively managed mutual funds and longshort hedge funds are going to take a longerterm view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling and yes they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others but even if they start to suspect every company should be down as a result of tariffs theyre not going to smash a big red button labeled sell everything because thats not their job maybe its somebodys job to care but honestly its hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing if you realize a crash is coming but get the timing wrong you could lose a lot of moneylike if you went allin shorting the market in when the dotcom bubble wouldnt burst until the following year and if get the timing of this crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves how does that let you correctly time the next crash its not a lot to build a career on hell its one thing to know about freight schedules another thing to predict when the market will notice it could crash tomorrow on bad firstquarter gdp numbers or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in and i certainly dont claim to know how badly the us will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it which is why my moneys in a mix of international stocks and international bonds rather than simply one or the other what i can tell you is this unfortunately you cant assume surely somebody would do something about it if there were a totally predictable crash incoming nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do act
