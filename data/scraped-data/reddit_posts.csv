"Sold Hood and started positions in Apple, Google, NVDA today","Recently I sold all my Hood shares (I got 4300 shares). Got some cash ready and didn't want to miss any market rallies, so I used 1/3 of my available funds to start:

300 shares NVDA (about $41k)
150 shares Google ($26k)
60 shares Apple ($12$)

What do you think? I heard lots of good things about VEO 3 and Google is one of the leaders in quantum computing. Apple is always a strong company. They will have smart glasses & foldable phones next year maybe. Then NVDA with a great ER beat but stock got hold down due to tariff news. These 3's average price targets have about 15-25% upside. I'll be happy if they give me 15-20% return by year's end. ",coopermug,2025-05-30 01:27:26,0,investing,NVDA
Semis not recovering despite new wave of AI spending?,"Looking at how SMH did recently I can't help to feel frustrated with my position in this sector. The tariffs threat is still here, but on the other hand we had several new multi billions investment planned for building AI factories, which will need the entire semis production chain. There is a clear surge in the robotics and autonomous driving sector. This will need more GPUs than we currently have.
Moreso, we have seen how NVDA keeps delivering. And yet, SMH can't recover some of its previous highs.

I am fully aware that this is a cyclical and high beta sector, but it feels now that the bad perform has stretched for too long.

NVIDIA Earnings Tomorrow – The Market’s Locomotive Report. Thoughts?,"NVIDIA is reporting earnings tomorrow, and honestly, it feels like the entire market is holding its breath. Whether you're in tech, semis, or just broad index funds, NVIDIA has become the locomotive pulling this market forward.

Investor sentiment, momentum,... — all could shift depending on how NVDA performs.

Personally, I am expecting a really strong report. Demand for AI infrastructure is still booming, The AI Economy is booming, and NVIDIA has been at the center of it.

TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.

I've been wrong before, but...

I sold half my position in 2022 thinking the Twitter acquisition would tank Tesla. Cost me about $40K in potential gains when it rebounded. The lesson I learned was that betting against Tesla's long-term vision because of short-term issues has consistently been a losing strategy.

That said, I'm not blind to the risks:

P/E of 171 is insane by traditional metrics

BYD is eating their lunch in China and now Europe

Insider selling has been heavy (Musk, CFO, directors)

The new affordable model keeps getting delayed

What's your take?

Am I crazy for holding through this? Has anyone else noticed the energy business numbers? And what's your read on the robotaxi timeline - real innovation or more Musk hype?",faharxpg,2025-05-27 09:58:01,122,investing,TSLA

Buying Puts For A Correction,"Last week, I sold a few stocks, expecting that the S&P 500 (SPX) (SPY) was due for a pullback/correction. Since then, the SPY made a triple top at 595.54 on May 20th, close to its Dec 2024 top of 609.07, and Feb 19, 2025 top of 613, – **this looks like a triple top unless NVDA takes it higher Wednesday / Thursday after earnings.** The SPY closed at 579.11 on Friday, the 23rd, almost 3% lower. I believe this is the start of a correction, which should likely take the SPY to around 540, about 10% lower. **I plan to buy July 31st and August 31st, 540 strike price, SPY puts.**

**Why am I bearish?**

**There are the 4 main reasons:**

1. The first and foremost reason for the weaknesses in bonds is higher borrowing costs for the US government. The 30-year treasury yield currently stands at 5.04% and seems likely to climb as the US Congress passes a budget with a running deficit of 124% of GDP, which increases the deficit further. It also assumes a large amount of customs duties as tariff income, and DOGE cost-cutting as savings. In my opinion, both are rosy projections and will probably exacerbate the deficit. Interest **payments have surpassed defence as the largest line item on the government’s books.** The downgrade from Moody’s will further increase interest rates, which will lead to a drop in the stock markets.
2. The second is tariffs, which will show up in earnings in Q2-Q3; we can’t escape them. Even as tariffs have whittled down to an estimated 15% to 20% on average, we shouldn’t forget that last year, tariffs averaged 3-4%. This is a fourfold increase and will fuel inflation and stagflation, and affect corporate bottom lines if they’re not passed on. And passing them on to customers would likely lead to a decrease in demand, which would still reduce corporate bottom lines. There are no easy solutions to tariffs.
3. The third is an overpriced S&P 500 index, which at 5,803, yields an earnings yield of $260/5,803 = 4.48%. Why would you buy a risk-yielding asset for 4.48% when the 10-year U.S. treasury offers you 4.54%? The S&P 500 is priced at 22.3 times 2025 earnings, higher than the 10-year average of 19.5. Besides, the 19.5x multiple was when interest rates averaged closer to 3%. Simply, the risk premium is not enough for me.
4. The fourth is the persistent weakness and uncertainty in economic data. Home sales are one example. According to Redfin, 56,000 home purchase contracts fell through in April 2025, or about 14% of sales, a level last seen in 2017. Existing home sales fell another 2% in April on top of the large drop in March of 5%, the largest drop since 2022. PMI readings for services and manufacturing came in at 52.3 for April, a decent number by any standards, but with accompanying color stating the obvious – **“Detrimental concerns of tariff uncertainties on demand and supply chains.”** Tariff uncertainty has led to the largest accumulation of inventories in the last 18 years. Given this buildup, it would only be fair to assume that the next two quarters will not grow as well as Q1-2025.

Uncertainty on tariffs (Friday’s call for 50% tariffs on the EU and 25% tariffs on iPhones, not made in the US) increases volatility in bond and stock markets. Other, similar arbitrary executive actions, such as the revocation of Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students, can also have economic repercussions. Currently, like so many other cases on immigration and tariffs challenging executive actions, this one too is in court. Which one could lead to a constitutional crisis? All of these suggest that bond markets could remain weak for a “structural credit risk” reason – the US never had that problem, but I believe it could remain a problem during the Trump presidency. It already is a bearish indicator in the form of higher borrowing costs from international lenders not willing to lend at lower rates.

**How much longer can Buy The Dip save the stock market? We are ignoring the dangers ahead.**

The CNN Greed and Fear index has gone from Extreme Fear to Greed in just one month and is flirting with Extreme Greed.

**In my opinion, the fair value of the SPY is around 520 or 5,200 for the S&P 500, based on a P/E multiple of 20 x 260 per share = 5,200, and I’ll buy Puts to hedge my portfolio for the dangers ahead.**

GENIUS stablecoin and potential push for tokenization,"/\* posted in /stocks but was removed due to off-topic...

It is entertaining to read X recently. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to cut interest rates, in hope that the rate cut will push economic growth and reduce treasury yield. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to increase interest rate, so it makes USD more appealing and reduces treasury yield. Regardless, treasury yield keeps going up. The same story of basis trade and carry trade is playing again today.

It is debatable whether we want a stronger dollar or a weak dollar, but reducing treasury yield seems to be the common goal. How could we easily create more demands for U.S. treasury bonds, when both sides of the aisle embraces the deficit expansion to the core? Well, we can force people into buying treasury bonds, we can wage a war to scare people, or we can create some phantom demands. This is where the GENIUS act may come handy.

The grand scheme is to bring assets on-chain, which requires the players to escrow real-world-assets (RWAs) and issue tokens backed with it. Geez, this sounds like mortgage backed securities and ETF already. To trade those assets, we need currencies, mostly the stablecoins. The GENIUS Act requires holding of USD or treasury bonds, which the issuers will gladly support. Let us imagine that we move NYSE and NASDAQ on-chain and create a copy of all stocks, we suddenly create demand for USD, treasury, and stocks from some users that can't access the U.S. market. Even our dear general Kim can tornado his stash and buy Apple at that time.

Wait! This already happened! Kraken tokenized AAPL, NVDA and TSLA today. Many other crypto firms have worked on RWA for years, including stocks, game skins, etc. GAINS even created a 100x leveraged stock trading platform until they halted it due to heavy admin burden to monitor stock earning, dividends, splits, acquisitions, etc.

So we are likely to see a concerted effort to push assets on-chain in the coming months or years, which will benefit stocks like COIN, HOOD, XYZ, PYPL, and other players, and cryptos such as LINK. Electronic stablecoin payments for daily life is another direction, and I wonder how that will affect V and MA. The damage to both may take years though.

I’m scared. Michael Burry is betting against the market…,"Michael Burry—yes, the guy who called the 2008 crash—just went full doomsday on tech stocks.😢

•Alibaba
•Baidu
•JD
•Pinduoduo
…gone. 100% out.

Then he went all in on…
Estee Lauder. $EL
A 62% drop over the past 5 years.

•  $JD
• $PDD
• $BABA
…and wait for it
@nvidia $NVDA
And not just a few. Nvidia puts now make up 50% of his entire portfolio.

That’s either legendary conviction…
Or an early screening of the financial horror movie we’re all about to star in.

"S&P 500 dips, debt concerns in focus as Trump's tax bill faces overnight test","The S&P 500 slipped in volatile trading and Treasury yields rose on Wednesday as U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tax-cut law faced a rare overnight hearing aimed at influencing Republican holdouts opposed to the bill's passage.

The House Rules Committee scheduled an unusual 1 a.m. ET hearing that is expected to run well into daylight hours as Republicans try to overcome internal divisions about cuts to the Medicaid health program and tax breaks in high-cost coastal states.

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged, however, that a vote by the full chamber might not happen on Wednesday.

Nonpartisan analysts said the proposed plan could add between $3 trillion and $5 trillion to the federal government's $36.2 trillion debt.

""This tax bill could be a coin toss in its current form; it could go either way,"" said Mariam Adams, managing director at UBS Wealth Management.
""It really depends on how much relief the average investor... (is) receiving. If it can impact and give some kind of faith to individual investors, that could give us a really good rally.""

At 11:53 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 332.05 points, or 0.78%, to 42,345.19, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 10.06 points, or 0.17%, to 5,930.40, and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) gained 70.80 points, or 0.36%, to 19,213.51.
Boosting the Nasdaq, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) jumped 4.9%, while Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) climbed close to 1% each.
Nine of the 11 S&P sub-sectors traded lower, with Health Care (.SPXHC) being the worst hit.

U.S. bonds have been pressured since the start of the week, when Moody's downgraded the country's sovereign credit rating. Yields on the 30-year note were back up to 5.01% on Wednesday, with the benchmark 10-year yield climbing 5.2 basis points to 4.53%.

UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) dropped 4.5% after a Guardian report said the healthcare conglomerate secretly paid nursing homes thousands in bonuses to help reduce hospital transfers for ailing residents. HSBC also downgraded the stock to ""reduce"" from ""hold"".

In earnings, retailer Target (TGT.N) fell 3.5% after slashing its annual forecast due to a pullback in discretionary spending.
Wolfspeed (WOLF.N) tumbled nearly 70% following a report that the semiconductor supplier was preparing to file for bankruptcy within weeks.

Despite the losses, U.S. stocks have had a solid month so far. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 17% from its April lows, when Trump's reciprocal tariffs roiled global markets.

A pause in the tariffs, a temporary U.S.-China trade truce and tame inflation data have pushed equities higher, although the S&P 500 is still about 3% off its record highs.

Brokerage Morgan Stanley upgraded its stance on U.S. equities to ""overweight"", saying the global economy was still expanding, albeit slowly, amid policy uncertainty.

Meanwhile, bitcoin scaled a fresh all-time high of $109,481.83. Exchange operator Coinbase (COIN.O) gained 2.1% and crypto miners including Riot Platforms (RIOT.O) rose about 3%.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.76-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.02-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 46 new lows.

AMZN to new ATH despite tariffs?,Positions are 3 $240 march 20 2026 puts backed by 70k in TBIL.  The tariffs are of course bad for the retail side but it seems every quarter more and more of profits and revenue are coming from AWS all this AI is going to need data centers and hosting.  I picked $240 because that's just under the 52 week high.  I suppose maybe $230 would be safer but with AWS growing the way it is setting a new all time high in the next 2 years should happen.  If I get assigned above 200 I'll just sell a 2 week ATM or slightly OTM call and close out the position that way.  Shoved the entire premium into TBIL so the interest on that will should help magnify gains and offset some of the losses if I'm wrong.  I'm thinking if tariffs do stay at a blanket 10% Amazon will raise prices and 3rd party sellers will raise prices so profit margin will stay the same but revenue will be slightly inflated. ,Embarrassed_Durian17,2025-05-19 02:13:05,0,investing,AMZN
Experienced trader looking for advice on tools,"I'm a longtime trader who recently caught a sizeable windfall in the markets which has motivated me to do something I've been meaning to do for a long time: Consolidate my various accounts, move to a DMA broker, upgrade my toolsets and services, and hone my skills so I can trade more in this crazy new climate we find ourselves in. I scalp futures contracts almost exclusively, and swing trade the big stocks/funds. I also have long term investments that I don't touch except to rebalance.

I also happen to be a professional software developer, over 20 years with .Net/Rust and various smaller frameworks. I'm getting into algo trading slowly. I have accounts with TradeStation, IBKR, and NinjaTrader since their SDK is C#. I'm probably going to ditch IBKR b/c TradeStation so far has been amazing. NinjaTrader isn't DMA, but being able to write complex algorithms in a programming language I know is a huge plus.

I have some questions about tools as I inherently trust nothing on the internet, I figure everybody is in everybody else's pocket. 
- Is Benzinga Pro everything it's cracked up to be? Or is there a better source of news, e.g. Bloomberg, CNBC, etc. It's expensive, but anything that can give me an edge on the market I consider extremely valuable.
- Is using a trading journal service worth it? I have my eye on TraderSync, but TradeStation comes with some decent reporting tools that export to excel. TraderSync is also expensive so I'm wondering what edge it would give a scalper.
- Are signaling services worth it? I've seen Eagle Investors and Trade Ideas mentioned a few times on various /r's. How do they signal? Webhooks would be great so I could integrate it into MSFT Teams. And yes I know better than to use them as a single source of truth, confirm with other tools.

My current toolset consists of heavy technical analysis, TradingView (ultimate edition or whatever it's called), and Tradestation tools (TS Workstation, Maestro, but I'm not great at backtesting tbh) in addition to Benzinga and other reputable news sources, but they aren't fast enough which is why I'm asking about the signaling services. I do fairly well, > 50% profitable trades and always end up in the green at the end of the month, if even by just a hair :-) I can say with great certainty that moving to DMA has already increased profits, so I'm very willing to invest both time and money learning new tech if it gives me an edge. Their desktop client is amazing, but I'm still learning it. Being able to set trailing stops is extremely nice.

(My ultimate goal btw is to integrate all of this into code I'll write, but that's down the line, I'm in the requirements gathering phase of the SDLC)

Have I bought too much MAG 7?,"I’m 20 and I’m from Australia. Pretty new to buying US stocks. However because of the market downturn I’ve bought some MAG 7 companies that I believe in as follows:

AMZN - position: 5.6 - Avg price: 188.3 

NVDA - position: 3.9 - Avg price: 111.3

GOOG - position: 1.9 - Avg price: 161.9

AAPL - position: 0.46 - Avg price: 214.1

But now I’m thinking I’ve invested too much into most of the MAG 7, instead of doing this I could have just put it into a SNP500 fund (I also invest in ETFs, have a good amount in VGS and VAS) 

The company I’m most bullish about is AMZN and recently been reading about GOOG being undervalued. Some should I keep these and then just focus on the two I’m most confident about or keep doing what I’m doing? Some advice would be great thanks.

"Is investing in stocks already heavily favored by ETFs smart? Furthermore, is 100% stock portfolios worth the risk?","I left a comment elsewhere which after posting it made me curious about making it a post. Forgive me if I spell something incorrectly, English is not my first language.

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4590406

So I read this paper about 100% Stock portfolios after watching a YouTube video on it (multiple out there).

And I wondered how I’d go about choosing the stocks I’d invest in. I did so because just last year I didn’t touch stocks but when I went on my app on my iPhone (Stocks) and saw how much I could have made had I just invested in stocks that were already a big presence in almost all of my ETFs the. I’d have more value to my name.

To look at it I viewed an era that had large fluctuations in which I invested in which lead me to 2019 to 2024 because in-between that we had the fed-induced boom and the crash that came before that along with other crazy fluctuations.

So for my example I used march 2019 to March 2024 (which had steep decreases and increases):

1.MSFT: 250.92% 
2.Apple: 248%
3.Meta: 176.44%
4.Googl: 149%
5.Amazon: 96.46%

1.QQQ: 140.45%
2.VTI: 84.34%
3.VOO: 81.39%
4.VT: 54.38%

Here is the Summary of percentages those sticks hold for each ETF:

1. QQQ: ~41.3%
2. VOO: ~22.2%
3. VTI: ~13.0%
4. VT: ~6.1%


It’s not like investing in Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon is unheard of, they already make a huge part of all ETFs you come across that measure commonly used domestic indexes. So… is this the way? I truly want your critique on this because if it works it works and if not then it doesn’t, it’s not about proving I’m right it’s about maximizing my understanding of investing. 



Edit: I think people misunderstood and I didn’t articulate it well either. IM NOT PREACHING FOR 100% stocks but I want your opinions on it! I want to see if maybe it IS the way. I want to grow my knowledge on the topic.

"OpenAI, Microsoft, AMD To Present Senate With AI Wishlist To Beat China","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is expected to emphasize the need for public investment in infrastructure, while Microsoft President Brad Smith would reportedly highlight concerns around export restrictions on U.S. AI chips.

Top executives from OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and CoreWeave (CRVW) are scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday, urging lawmakers to back policies that strengthen the U.S. lead in artificial intelligence (AI) amid rising competition from China.

The hearing, led by Senator Ted Cruz, comes as Washington faces renewed pressure to counter advances by Chinese firms. 

Last year, DeepSeek—a Hangzhou-based company—surprised the global tech community by unveiling a capable, lower-cost AI model that challenged OpenAI and Meta Platforms (META) offerings.

U.S. tech leaders have since stepped up lobbying efforts, arguing that AI aligned with democratic norms is a strategic imperative. The industry wants looser regulations and increased support for critical infrastructure such as semiconductors and supercomputing capacity.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is expected to emphasize the need for public investment in infrastructure. 

“Infrastructure is destiny, and we need a lot more of it,” he is expected to say, according to his prepared remarks cited by Reuters. Altman, who in earlier testimony before Congress advocated strong regulation to mitigate AI risks, now says scaling AI requires “more chips, training data, energy, and supercomputers.”

Microsoft President Brad Smith would reportedly highlight concerns that export restrictions on U.S. AI chips could push global buyers toward Chinese alternatives. 

AMD CEO Lisa Su and CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator would also pressure lawmakers to back policies supporting U.S.-based AI development.

The Biden administration’s sweeping curbs on AI chip exports to China aimed to limit Beijing’s military advancement. However, the Trump administration is preparing to rescind those controls. 

According to a report by Bloomberg, Trump will not enforce the Biden-era “AI diffusion rule” when it takes effect on May 15, part of a broader plan to overhaul semiconductor trade restrictions that have drawn industry backlash.

U.S. export restrictions on advanced chips to China have caused major revenue losses for chipmakers. AMD expects up to $800 million in charges related to unsellable inventory and commitments, while Nvidia faces a $5.5 billion write-down due to its H20 chips being blocked from the Chinese market.

“The way to beat China in the AI race is to outrace them in innovation, not saddle AI developers with European-style regulations,” Cruz said when announcing the hearing.

AMD’s stock is down over 15% year-to-date, while Nvidia shares have dropped nearly 14%.",FreeCelery8496,2025-05-08 15:15:32,15,investing,MSFT

Any other business owners use market puts as business insurance?,"Hi, first post in this forum and just curious if anyone else does this. I own a lawn care company and a design build firm. Something that always keeps me up at night is a major recession/depression happening. I started dabbling in the market in college and then really started investing in COVID and all around really paying attention. Something I have had alot of success with and has really helped me sleep at night is PUTs. I have been nervous last couple years economy wise and for $10k to $30k a year or so in portfolio ""drag"" I can buy pretty phenomenal insurance just incase. For example, bought puts against SPY/SYF/STLA this last fall through Feb bc I was/am nervous and it worked out really well. I sold out about 70% of peak value bc it was too much up/down for me and 5x'd what I had in, peak it was over 10x what I had in. I am now back in PUTs against AAPL and SPY again bc I still have same nerves and seeing market get frothy/return to pretty high levels and want to keep my ""insurance"".

Microsoft Stock Lands Rare Downgrade After ‘Exceptional’ Quarter — But It Has Nothing To Do With Fundamentals: Retail’s Bullish,"The firm believes that Microsoft is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for expensive artificial intelligence models.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has gained 10% over the two sessions since it reported its third-quarter results. 

Friday’s close of $435.28 meant Microsoft stock has turned positive for the year with a year-to-date gain of 3.5%.

Notwithstanding the investor optimism over the Satya Nadella-led company, an analyst downgraded the stock on Sunday. The Fly reported that research firm Phillip Securities downgraded the Microsoft stock to ‘Accumulate’ from ‘Buy’ but left the price target unchanged at $480.

The firm attributed the downgrade to the stock rally amid the recent market upturn and the company’s earnings.

Phillip Securities analysts, however, believe that Microsoft is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for expensive artificial intelligence (AI) models, which in turn enhances the attractiveness of the Azure public cloud platform.

The firm also sees minimal impact from the Trump tariffs, given Microsoft’s strong enterprise customer base and the accent on its cloud service.

Microsoft stock is still trading off its all-time high of $467.70, hit on July 8, 2024.

Last Wednesday, Microsoft reported a solid third-quarter beat and issued positive guidance. The company also said it expects strong Azure revenue growth and a sequential increase in capital spending.

Following the results, Microsoft analysts hiked their price targets, with the new targets ranging from $475 to $550. Analysts called the quarter an “exceptional one.”",FreeCelery8496,2025-05-05 09:56:34,29,investing,MSFT

Financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to the S&P 500 the day after tomorrow,"Container volumes at the port of Los Angels are down this week. They'll be down farther next week. We know this because arrivals are scheduled in advance and crossing the ocean by boat takes awhile. Container volumes at east coast ports are expected to do the same thing, but on a delayed schedule, because ""Shanghai, through the Panama Canal to New York City"" is a longer trip than ""Shanghai to Los Angels"".

And because of *that*, it's a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month. Large-scale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter. Very little can be done to stop this, because even if the tariffs on China were lifted tomorrow, it takes 3-7 weeks to get merchandise from a Chinese port to an American retail store. (Plus, I feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on China won't be lifted any time soon.)

A natural question when you hear this is, ""if that's true, why isn't the stock market down more?"" And I think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as: **hardly anyone is paid to care.**

I was going to title this post ""financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow"", but the **index fund providers** *are* paid to care... in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error. They are paid to make sure that when the index goes up X%, the fund captures those games, and when the index goes down Y%, the fund doesn't do any worse than that. But they aren't paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow. And this is not a criticism! It's not their job.

Who's job is it? For **high-frequency traders**, it's pretty much the opposite of their job. Their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a penny-per-share profit. And some of the hate HFTs get strikes me as overwrought; before HFTs were skimming a penny a share off every trade, floor traders were skimming 12½ cents (because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar). But HFTs definitely don't care about what's going to happen to the trucking industry next month.

Now, despite what you may have heard, HFTs aren't the *entire* stock market. HFTs like to do small, quick trades. So instead, if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of TSLA, they might call around to various **dealers** and ask for quotes. The dealers will quote numbers below what an HFT would pay for *ten* shares of TSLA, but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal, and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else, and that can't be done in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe they unwind their position over the course of 24 hours. So when the dealer gives a quote, they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrow—but they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody else's problem.

Okay, but those are the middle-men. What about **professional stock-pickers**, active mutual fund managers, long-short hedge fund managers? Unfortunately, they also aren't paid to care what the S&P 500 will do the day after tomorrow. Managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark, which is generally an index. If the index is down, that's fine, as long as *their* stocks are down less (or perhaps realistically, for risk-averse managers, aren't down significantly more). Meanwhile, a long-short hedge fund, which buys some stocks while shorting others, wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have *no effect whatsoever* on the fund's performance.

So yes, actively managed mutual funds and long-short hedge funds are going to take a longer-term view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling. And yes, they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others. But even if they start to suspect *every* company should be down as a result of tariffs, they're not going to smash a big red button labeled ""sell everything"", because that's not their job.

Maybe it's *somebody's* job to care, but honestly it's hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing. If you realize a crash is coming, but get the timing wrong, you could lose a lot of money—like if you went all-in shorting the market in 1999, when the dot-com bubble wouldn't burst until the following year. And if get the timing of *this* crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves, how does that let you correctly time the next crash? It's not a lot to build a career on.

Hell, it's one thing to know about freight schedules, another thing to predict when the *market* will notice. It could crash tomorrow on bad first-quarter GDP numbers, or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work, or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in. And I certainly don't claim to know how badly the US will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it, which is why my money's in a mix of international stocks and international bonds, rather than simply one or the other.

What I can tell you is this: unfortunately, you can't assume surely *somebody* would do something about it, if there were a totally predictable crash incoming. Nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do. Act accordingly.",TopherBrennan,2025-04-30 01:12:12,460,investing,TSLA
Is PLTR or TSLA a Better Position for AI Growth???,"I want to increase AI exposure in my portoflio because I am really bullish on AI for the future. Im debating between PLTR and TSLA.

The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad.

Anyway, today I am finally unstuck. I survived Liberation Day and all the other bullshit and endless bad press. Not going to be a pig… having BA drop to $200 or less would hurt WAY more than BA running to $240 would feel good. So ready to unload these bags and today I did. 
  
TL;DR — aped into BA early last year. Got slaughtered. Aped in even more. Finally got unstuck and made a whopping $250 for my troubles. ",literanch,2025-06-02 21:42:30,316,wallstreetbets,NVDA

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Other noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.",callsonreddit,2025-06-01 13:08:47,408,wallstreetbets,NVDA

$155 NVDA by July 3rd 2025,"I believe this qualifies as a YOLO post. These are the reasons:

* NVDA has a 69% increase in YoY even with the 5B lost from China export restrictions
* NVDA only dropped to $94/share during the Liberation Day crash demonstrating resilience
* NVDA's 52-week high is $153.13 which was just 4 months ago
* Jensen is buddies with Mango

"NVIDIA's AI dominance is solid! Q1 data center business carries the flag, demand remains strong, the second half of the year may usher in a","After the U.S. stock market session on Wednesday, May 28, EST, artificial intelligence (AI) general leader $ NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$ released financials for the company's first fiscal quarter of FY2026 ending April 27, 2025, as well as earnings guidance for the second fiscal quarter of FY2026. The results were better than expected overall, despite pressure from U.S. government export restrictions. Shares of NVIDIA are up over 6% at today's U.S. stock open.

Overall, NVIDIA Q1 operating income of $44.1 billion, a year-on-year growth of 69%, exceeding analysts' expectations of $43.309 billion, NVIDIA's own guidance of $42.14 billion to $43.86 billion, the previous quarter grew 78% year-on-year. NVIDIA revenue year-on-year growth rate, the lowest single-quarter growth rate in two years, but still stronger than analysts expected growth rate of 66%.

Earnings, Q1 NVIDIA H20 chip export restrictions on NVIDIA had a significant impact. NVIDIA adjusted EPS growth of 33% year-on-year, less than half of the previous quarter's 71% growth rate, $ 0.81 EPS is lower than analysts' expectations of nearly 13%. However, if you exclude the impact of H20 expenses, EPS rebounded to $0.96, also more than 3% higher than analysts' expectations of $0.93.

Gross margins changed similarly, with Q1 adjusted gross margin at 61%, down 17.9 percentage points year-on-year and well below analysts' expectations of 71%. And excluding the impact of H20 gross margin was 71.3%, roughly in line with analyst expectations and NVIDIA's own guidance.

ANET (NVDA Sympathy Yolo). 96.5 May 30 call,"My thesis for NVDA earnings is - decent announcement with good forward guidance as sovereign AI becomes more a thing especially in the middle east.  Coupled with some guidance about China as chip restrictions change. With market cap approaching 4T - stock moves will be muted on the upside. I'd say it's a flat to modest move (price target 142$). 

Other plays like SOXL should see lots of gains on general overall positive semiconductor sentiment. I'm also in SOXL long. 

My play is ANET for sympathy. Calls are cheap. Thesis on ANET move is based on a general indicator of continued and expanding data center mega-investment and capital spending which ANET benefits. 

Currently sitting at 30% below 52 week high. ANET chart YTD is basically mirror image of NVDA (but so are lots of stocks so doesn't mean much). At current closing price we're only 4.8% off of break even price.

I'm looking for a 25% move to $115 or a 250k net on a 6k cost basis.

NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence,"Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since [the launch of ChatGPT ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[ a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html) in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong,"TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  
\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   
\-I expect growth QoQ   
\-it's not priced in  
\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads

Positions: 

[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)

At the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.

https://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99

The current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?

People will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**

The charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.

A deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.

These are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.

According to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.

My initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.

[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)

As for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.

According to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.

The company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.

Since the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.

I estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.

So, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.

**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**

Even if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.

**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** 

**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",hazxrrd,2025-05-24 23:36:03,35,wallstreetbets,NVDA

Realistically what is going to happen with TSLA robotaxi launch,"Basically the headline.

Honestly i haven’t seen a lot of quality discussion about the planned robotaxi launch in June. Otherthan bulls and bears yelling on each other and random meme shit. 
Let’s collect all the facts and try to find what’s gonna happen in few weeks. 

Here are some facts we know so far and i will try to be impartial as i can be and just state facts and not my opinion. 
- Elon announced robotaxi planned launch in Austin in June. 
- TSLA stock has rallied 40+ % since the announcement. 
- TSLA sales are being disastrous worldwide and on going sales news are negative. Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. 
- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. 
- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. 
- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. 
- We haven’t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)
- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch.

"US to keep China chip curbs, spurning Nvidia’s call for relief","No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-keep-china-chip-curbs-170252299.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-keep-china-chip-curbs-170252299.html)

(Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.

“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”

“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",callsonreddit,2025-05-21 19:18:44,67,wallstreetbets,NVDA

46k gain on $WRD in 1 day,"**Reasons I bought/will hold:**

1. NVDA is holding 1.7 million share at 16.4$ average cost.
2. Uber is investing 100 million into the company, and they just recently delivered the first driverless robotaxi rides in the Middle East. WeRide also collaborating extensively with UAE government.
3. Manufacturing costs substantially lower than Waymo - this is perhaps the key advantage of robotaxi stocks who collaborates with Chinese auto firms. Waymo is currently seeking partnerships with Zeekr, which means that WeRide is one step ahead.
4. Pony AI was originally 3x their market cap, despite arguably worst products - especially in terms of overall safety record. WeRide has had 0 incidents to date.
5. WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.
6. Strategic collaboration with Tencent, with future incorporation into Tencent's super app WeChat. This will help broaden WeRide's reach, while also providing WeRide with ample cloud resources.
7. Listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely coming this year. Given how well IPOs have done (e.g. CATL) on there this year and WeRide's cheap valuation, one can expect a significant boost to the stock.
8. CEO and CTO are both highly competent, who helped pioneer the industry in China at Baidu.

Overall, I think this is perhaps one of the best ways to play the robotaxi theme. My plan is to hold my shares for the next few years as the fleet grows. Will look to add more on pullbacks.",backwardsfrog,2025-05-21 15:47:58,30,wallstreetbets,NVDA

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know,"Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.

Huang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.

Shares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.

At last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.

""We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,"" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.

Other chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.

**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**

Investors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.

Home Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.

Rival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.

The expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.

Cybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.

International travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.

Investors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.

**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**

Several Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.

An Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.

Market watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.

Investors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",callsonreddit,2025-05-18 11:27:46,115,wallstreetbets,TSLA

Are investors really banking on NVDA not being able to keep up the AI dominance and having AMD slowly chip away at the market share/piece of the pie? Is AMD really banking on increasing their 2nd place spot by hoping and praying the 1st place spot lags or falls behind? 9/10 smart investors should take NVDA over AMD simply because of their numbers. Their business is better, the numbers are better, hello? AMD investors are hoping and wishing that they can keep this whale in its fishing rod, but it’s dragging the whole boat. From a rational standpoint, AMD is way too close to NVDA on the podium. NVDA should be #1 by 10x. AMD can’t keep up. And if investors acted with their rational mind, they would pick the clear winner-picker choice - and not a choice based off a prayer or hope.

"This market is disgustingly overpriced, and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during Dot Com/Global financial crisis.","I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.

**Some quick points:**

**1. Price to earnings ratio**

Price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.

The entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.

Who in the world would be interested in signing up for that ""investment"" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.

**2. The Buffett indicator**

The Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.

Historically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.

**3. The stock market is insanely top heavy.**

The Mag 7 currently account for 31% of the S&P 500, and over 40% of the Nasdaq. If these 7 stocks correct, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole. We saw this play out during Dot Com with the likes of Cisco, Intel, and Oracle. While the market was top heavy then -- it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today... In fact -- the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when Dot Com crashed.

Side note -- but I do think investors have briefly taken note of this. So much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that can/will be generated by AI. But remember what happened when DeepSeek emerged last year -- and alerted WallStreet that an incredibly sophisticated AI can be created without pouring billions of dollars into R&D and infrastructure? The market absolutely tanked. What if it becomes obvious that these AI plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world, and that these systems can be developed by any mid-cap with a decent budget?

**4. Home prices and the Housing Market**

I won't dive too deep into this, but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in US history. Based on median US income and Median US home price, right before the Global financial crisis/mortgage crisis of 08/09 -- this number hit it's highest point in US history -- 45%.

Its highest percent *until* the last 12 months. It now takes over 46% of a family's income to purchase a home.  
30% is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable.

The condo market is collapsing, particularly in Florida, where HOA dues and Insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable.

Foreclosures on FHA loans are also set to resume. Biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after COVID... meaning call your servicer, say you're experiencing a hardship, and they simply give you a deferral. None of these homes could be foreclosed upon. They then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest. This policy still exists today, but is about to come to an end in September. As of Q1 2025, over 10.6% of all FHA mortgages are at least one payment late. Over 4% of FHA mortgages are over 90 days late.

What happens when FHA foreclosures absolutely flood the market?

What does this do to home prices, and even more importantly, what does this do to homebuilders? If inventory skyrockets (more than it already has over the last couple of months), and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply, will home builders still be able to make money? Homebuilding employs over 11 million americans... Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, drywallers, framers, truck drivers, etc --

When homes stop being built, unemployment skyrockets, and GDP shrinks dramatically.

**5. Consumer debt is through the roof**

Credit card debt is at the highest it's ever been, and delinquency rates are as high as they've been since emerging from the global financial crisis. Q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high.

Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been in decades.

**6. Bonds -- worldwide -- are pushing higher and higher.**

The US is getting hit here worse than most, as it seems people are not excited about Trump's game of chicken with tariffs. Nonetheless -- you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide, as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk. Interest rates cuts have not quelled this. Despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year, the 10 year t-note is actually up 80 ticks since then.

**7. Commercial real estate**

A massive amount of commercial real-estate will need to be refinanced in the coming 12-24 months -- and you will see these payments skyrocket. Many holders of Commercial real-estate refinanced their properties in the quarters after COVID, when interest rates were incredibly low. Most of these loans are either done on 5-year balloons, or as adjustable rate mortgages. These owners will see their payments jump by 30,50, even 70% as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time. This will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models, or at least partial work from home models. Office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed -- meaning less tenants -- all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing.

**8. Student Loan Debt**

The government's moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end. 43 million Americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5+ years are now going to have to start making payments. Those that don't will see their credit score be absolutely decimated. What other payments will the begin to fall behind on? As I mentioned previously -- credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high -- and rising. How much worse does that get when 15% of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month?

There is a dozen other items I could list here, but in the interest of actually getting some work done today, I'll leave my post there.

I would genuinely love for someone to refute places I'm missing the mark, or why I may be wrong about my assumptions above.

"VOO etf vs ""safe"" + growth big cap stocks?","Hi guys, so I know this question was asked before. But I hope to hear your opinions on this. I know buying VOO etf and contribute every month is the key. However, I can't ignore the fact that there are some relatively safe mega cap companies with growth potential like NVDA, Amazon, Google. etc. As of now, my portfolio includes NVDA, amazon, google, Apple & baba.

I did a quick calculation on compounding interest for VOO. In 5 years, with an average of 9% return (I am being conservative here), a $50k initial investment with no monthly contribution in VOO could be $76,931. So basically around 50% return after 5 years. If I put $1000 monthly contribution, the amount would be $148,747 after 5 years. This is almost triple.

Now mega caps like amazon, google, NVDA, a 50% increase in their market cap in 5 years is possible. But these companies are 2-3 trillions now. They will certain get bigger but 50% bigger is a lot and pretty sure they won't get triple in 5 years. Looking back 5 most recent years, SP500 has been up 94.58% while Amazon lags behind only 68.57%. Google did better at 139.82%. Apple is 153.9%. Microsoft is 152%. NVDA is a different monster at 1455%.

So now I start to regret my buying strategy. I should just buy VOO and make monthly contribution, and only keep smaller positions for these stock picks. Am I missing something here? is VOO's compound interest that powerful? is there any downside for investing in SP500 ?",coopermug,2025-06-03 06:55:09,0,stocks,NVDA

Recap Investopedia's coverage of last Friday's trading here. The week also brought the latest set of trade ructions, with President Donald Trump on Friday raising fresh questions about the state of affairs with China.

In addition to a jobs report due Friday, investors also will be watching for reports on job openings and private-sector payrolls. Updated data on the U.S. trade deficit and consumer credit levels will be in focus, as will manufacturing and services industry data, including the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), construction spending, and factory orders.

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Other noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.",callsonreddit,2025-06-01 13:22:39,55,stocks,NVDA

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Absolutely not, but I'm interested in seeing if we keep momentum upwards.

"We Should Never Have Doubted You, Jensen!","I had [mentioned yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kx5azw/nvidias_longterm_prospects_remain_terrific_im/) that I wasn’t going to hedge Nvidia’s Q1 earnings, ignore the noise, and stay invested for the long term. Now I’m kicking myself for not buying more when it was $130-$132. **Nonetheless, I plan to add more, paying $10 extra for a stock I expect to reach over $250 in the next three years, is OK. And I can always add more on declines.**

The small $ 1 Bn beat for Q1 results was impressive considering the $ 2.5 Bn in lost H-20 sales to China, but even more astounding was the reaffirmed guidance of $ 45 Bn for Q2, **in spite of $8 Bn in H-20 lost sales in Q2.** One can imagine where the stock would have skyrocketed if guidance had come in at $ 53 Bn instead of $ 45 Bn!

**Trying to thread the needle and trade Nvidia is missing the woods for the trees.** 

**Inferencing demand is a major revenue catalyst for Nvidia over the next several years, as evidenced by the significant increase in tokenization. Similarly, seen is Agentic AI demand, which is a revenue-bearing product of reasoning and inference, and will continue to grow.**

This was Jensen Huang on the conference call today on inference demand.

>“Well, we would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of it. Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through, is 100 times, 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos, and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks, the better the answer, the smarter the answer is. And so, what we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance, is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared. And so, this is going to be a huge, huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time.”

**One-year product cadence:** Nvidia has been very proactive when it comes to its product line-up, and showed off an ambitious slate of coming products at its [annual GTC conference](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/nvidias-big-show-hits-its-marks-but-plays-to-tough-crowd-35462acb?mod=article_inline) in March, including updated versions of its Blackwell chips that are in particularly high demand by companies trying to build up state-of-the-art AI networks. 

[According to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/nvidia-nvda-q1-earnings-report-2025-62ff6a10?mod=hp_lead_pos4), analysts expect the Blackwell lineup alone to generate nearly $98 billion in sales in the current fiscal year ending in January and a further $119 billion next year.

And Blackwell contributed about 70% of datacenter sales in Q1-26, successfully transitioning from the Hopper series

**I suspect that the $200 Bn revenue number for FY 2026 will be short, and with all the sovereign and other AI demand, it might even be exceeded, even without Chinese sales, with GPU cluster investment announcements from sovereign AI and Oracle and xAi, easily making up for the lost sales.**

Accelerated computing is the new paradigm, and I can see Nvidia dominating in every sphere of accelerated computing. 

From Jensen Huang on the Nvidia earnings call. 

>“So, that's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built, and -- but now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting. And so, computing is one stack, one part of it. But remember, enterprise IT is really three pillars; it's compute, storage, and networking. And we've now put all three of them together finally, and we're going to market with that.""



Cloud computing was just the start; these will follow. 

**On-Premise Computing and PCS** – Nvidia has already announced new products –  RTX Pro Enterprise AI server that runs everything On-Prem. DGX Spark and DGX Station, which are going to replace “traditional” CPU-run PCs, are designed for developers who want to work on-prem.

**Enterprise AI** is still a very nascent market and could be huge for Nvidia. A computing system that can integrate and run enterprise AI stacks, run enterprise IT stacks, but add AI to them. The Networking platform business using NVLink is available for competitors to make advanced GPU clusters.

**Physical and Industrial AI** – through the Omniverse and robotics: 

Jensen Huang on the earnings call:

> “And then lastly, industrial AI. Remember, one of the implications of the world reordering, if you will, is a region's onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories, of course, there are new electronics manufacturing, chip manufacturing being built around the world. And all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when Omniverse and AI and all the work that we're doing with robotics is emerging. And so, this fourth pillar is quite important.""



Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it. And in order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data. So, back to more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. And so, these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge.”

**NeoClouds** – Small business AI rentals through NeoClouds, like Coreweave and Nebius, should be a huge business. 

Lost in all this was Gaming revenue, which grew 42% to $3.76 billion, 33% above analysts’ forecasts! $ 1 Bn beat on $2.78 estimate – that is extremely impressive and attributed to Blackwell’s product strengths. Auto was another gainer, jumping to $567Mn up 72% YoY.

**I believe we’re in just the 2nd innings of a 9 innings AI revolution, and my 3-year target for Nvidia is $250, and I’ll continue to add on declines.**",Fountainheadusa,2025-05-29 13:14:51,0,stocks,NVDA

Nvidia's Long-Term Prospects Remain Terrific - I'm going to ignore Q1-earnings noise.,"Nvidia (NVDA) $135 Pre earnings

Nvidia’s Q1-FY2026 results may be noisy, but I’m not hedging it; I own shares, remain long-term bullish and will ignore earnings volatility, and may even add more.

Institutional or other investors who emphasize Blackwell absorbing H20 losses (About $13 Bn in lost annual sales and $5.5Bn in chargebacks for unsold inventory-due to the government ban on H20 exports to China) may be trying to thread the needle, **either believing that the markets will not be happy with the Blackwell ramp or the speed of the ramp to mitigate these lost sales. But for a company that is firing on so many cylinders, I’m sanguine about the Q1-FY2026 results, and am absolutely positive about the long-term prospects – it’s business as usual for the best of the best. This is a once-in-a-lifetime** opportunity, and for once it’s not a cliche.

The momentum around inferencing, and the computing power needs for inferencing and reasoning models suggest that Nvidia’s is a supply problem – and even if the $ 200 Bn revenue estimate for FY Jan 2026 is off by a small percent, FY 2027 to FY 2030, will more than make up for it. 

Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore, who has an Overweight rating and $160 price target on Nvidia, said the Jensen Huang-led company is likely to be fine if it can show investors that rack supply has accelerated.

**“Our data points would suggest that in recent weeks, the full year rack forecasts have started to be revised upwards by 50 %+,” Moore added, citing recent channel checks that suggest the issues have been resolved and are now starting to show up in numbers.**

**Additionally, investors appear to be underestimating the “unprecedented explosive token growth” commentary coming from Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Moore posited.**

**“Every hyperscaler has reported unanticipated strong token growth,” Moore explained. “But our conviction is not driven by that, it’s driven by the fact that literally everyone we talk to in the space is telling us that they have been surprised by inference demand, and there is a scramble to add GPUs.”**

Moore continued: “This is not driven by the limitless aspirations for training megaclusters fueled by highly speculative venture capitalists; **this is proof that the models are being used, and driving revenue,** which mitigates the biggest overhang on NVIDIA stock that this is all driven by venture funding that will dry up. **The strength we highlight here is driven by usage, by the revenue-generating part of the business, and provides proof points that the scaling of inference as we move to reasoning-oriented models is a real thing.** We are seeing this spanning geographies, as well, so published concerns about China having stockpiled H20s seem inaccurate.”

**I think Nvidia will have a similar overwhelming market share and growth in inference GPUs and their 1 year product roadmap ensures that they remain ahead of the competition– this is just the beginning.**",Fountainheadusa,2025-05-28 02:00:19,24,stocks,"MSFT,NVDA,AMZN"

No Apple, Amazon, or Tesla which are too consumer facing. Have the AI tech behemoths, which are also the true quantum plays. Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

TSLA vs. BYDDY – Which EV Stock Is the Better Bet Right Now?,"Let’s keep it real  Tesla’s got the hype, but BYD is quietly crushing it

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

"Nvidia earnings Trump tariff updates, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge: What to know this week","Stocks' feverish rebound over the past month is now on pause as growing concerns about the fiscal deficit have sent Treasury yields roaring higher and President Trump is once again threatening to escalate tariffs.



On Friday, Trump threatened to place a direct 25% tariff on Apple products not made in the US while also warning he'd ramp up duties on the European Union to 50% at the start of June. This solidified a week of decline for stocks as the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) dropped about 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (\^GSPC) slid roughly 2.6% on the week.



In the week ahead, updates on the trade war and Trump's pending tax bill will remain in focus, while quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to take center stage on Wednesday after the market close. Reports from Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), and Costco (COST) will also receive investor attention.



The release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge on Friday will headline the economic data schedule. Markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.



Tariff escalation

President Trump's policies have continued to drive markets. Concerns over Trump's tax bill boosting the government deficit have pushed Treasury yields higher. At over 5.1%, the 30-year Treasury yield (\^TYX) had been hovering near its highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield (\^TNX) had pressed above 4.6%, its highest level since February.



But the sell-off in bonds eased on Friday as Trump once again threatened to escalate tariffs, sending a reminder to investors that even with a 90-day tariff pause on a wide swath of countries, the trade policy whipsaw in markets is far from over.



""Safe to say for the time being we’ve hit 'trough' trade uncertainty,"" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""At this point markets need to see these tariffs retracted AND bond yields to not spike again for any material move higher.""



Friday's decline in treasuries sent the 10-year below the key 4.5% level Kantrowitz has been watching. As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate-sensitive stocks have seen increased underperformance in recent years.



This played out in last week's market action with the Russell 2000 Index (\^RUT), which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&P 500, falling nearly 4% compared to the S&P 500's 2.6% decline.



The AI leader reports

Nvidia is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday after the market close. Investors will be closely watching for any updates on demand from the leading supplier of AI chips. For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.



Given Nvidia's position as one of the top holdings in the S&P 500, investors will also be watching how the report affects other tech stocks and the broader market. Shares of Nvidia are roughly flat this year after whipsawing amid growing fears of AI competition and tariff concerns.



Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for about 17% of the S&P 500's gains.



Price check

Tariffs have increased fears that inflation could spike again. But there's been little evidence of a resurgence thus far in economic data, and economists expect a similar story to play out in the coming week.



A fresh look at a key inflation measure will come on Friday with the April PCE release. Economists project annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.5% in April, down from the 2.6% seen in March. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE at 0.1%, above the 0% seen the month prior.",Aluseda,2025-05-25 14:56:51,97,stocks,NVDA
Elon says he's back to work 24/7; bullish on TSLA,"So obviously after Elon hurt his reputation/brand after extremely unpopular political activities, it took a major outage at X dot com to result in this:

**Nvidia Earnings Highlight Slate of Tech, Retail, Financial Reports This Week**

Nvidia is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The chipmaking giant recently returned to the $3 trillion market-capitalization level after its share price rallied by around 50% from its April low. The earnings report follows the company’s announcement that it will supply semiconductors to Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain. Nvidia reported 78% year-over-year revenue growth in its prior earnings release. Semiconductor firm Marvell Technology is also scheduled to report this week.

Salesforce’s expected report on Wednesday comes after the cloud software provider reported 8% revenue growth in its prior quarter on the growth of its Agentforce custom AI platform. While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had strong potential for growth.

Thursday’s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it grew server and networking sales by 37% in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP’s scheduled report on Wednesday.

Costco Wholesale is on Thursday’s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco reported a 9% revenue growth in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.

AutoZone’s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an upgrade from Bank of America Securities as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick’s Sporting Goods’ expected report on Wednesday follows its recent deal to acquire sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).

Investors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which competes with Tesla (TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Inflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus

Friday’s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is closely watching prices in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.

Wednesday’s expected release of the minutes of the May meeting of the FOMC will provide more insight into Fed officials’ deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.

Revisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the economy shrank in the first three months of 2025.

The state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that consumers’ moods have soured over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday’s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy. ",callsonreddit,2025-05-25 13:16:24,70,stocks,"TSLA,NVDA"
Nvda (Nvidia) upcoming earnings will either pump or dump the market,"The last few nvidia earnings have been okay, and its been trading sideways for the most part. 

This upcoming earnings will be very different. I imagine nvidia earnings will be great, but outlook is the main problem, stock market is very future oriented. Trump has blocked more of nvidia sales to china, but also brokered more deals in the middle east. Tariffs also increasing prices etc. 

My question is what do you think nvidia will report on their future outlook, positive, negative or both? 

Currently ai is whats making the market go up, and nvidia is the current leader. If outlook is slightly negative, I believe the market will dump, if its really negative market is going to bleed badly.

"Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq trim losses as Trump threatens new tariffs on Apple and EU","U.S. stocks fell Friday and were on track to record a weekly loss as investors assessed the potential impact of President Trump's latest tariff threats and his massive tax bill on the deficit and economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( \^DJI ) fell 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 ( \^GSPC ) also fell about 0.3 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( \^IXIC ) was down about 0.6 percent.

Apple Inc (AAPL) must pay a 25 percent tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but not made in the U.S., Trump said on Friday, and all three major stock indexes trimmed their losses sharply. The tech giant has begun shifting some of its manufacturing operations to India, while China, home to its main suppliers, is mired in a trade war with the United States. Apple shares fell 3 percent after Trump's tweet on Truth Social.

On Friday afternoon, Trump hinted that the tariffs would apply to other cellphone makers.

Trump told reporters Friday afternoon: ""The tariffs are going to be higher, and Samsung and any company that makes that product is going to be affected, or it's not fair. Again, they don't have tariffs on building factories here. That's why they'll build a factory here.""

Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on EU imports “right up to 50 percent” as of June 1, as trade talks between China and Europe have stalled.",Aluseda,2025-05-23 19:44:52,121,stocks,AAPL

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Why Shorting Never Works,"Once upon a time the market attempted to price stocks for what they would be worth in the future. Buying and selling decisions were made based on fundamentals and forward guidance. Over time we have drifted from this concept, and become the market we have today. Debt, earnings, current revenue - these things do not matter. Bond yields at nosebleed levels? Who cares. All that matters is the potential for a revenue increase at an unknown date in the future. Look at quantum stocks, they are wildly overvalued by standard metrics. But they continue to fly higher. Why? Because at some point in the next 10-20 years they will earn more revenue than they do today. 

Look at CRWV, burning cash but promises to have future revenue (because companies who need ai compute capacity will never build out their own capacity right?), so it will continue to go up in a straight line. Likely for months or years, maybe forever. 

Look at TSLA. Huge future revenue promises for robotics and self driving. Maybe even ai too. Doesn’t matter if none of it happens, the stock will continue to move higher. 

Huge debt risks for the US? Downgrade and terrible 20 year bond auction showing risks of something very terrible coming? Doesn’t matter, indexes will always go up, there will be no dip that matters. It will always v up. The market IS different now. Debt will continue to grow and the globe will continue to support the US. If things get dire the government will just offer mild tariff relief if other countries agree to buy up massive amounts of US bonds and treasuries. The system will never fail, stop betting that it will.

The moral of the story here is simple, shorting never works. Period. Stocks that go down will go up more in the future. Because everyone believes that buying the dip works, it works. And it always will. This is likely very annoying for a lot of people who think valuations are high etc. If you are one of those people just give up. This time IS different. The globe has been conditioned to buy the dip. It will never stop. So join the herd or get run over by it. ",Consistent_Fish_7658,2025-05-22 18:08:31,0,stocks,TSLA

Q2 product revenue guidance of $1.035B–$1.045B implies \~25% growth (from a random SA article I read). Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.

The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.

(Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.

“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”

“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",callsonreddit,2025-05-21 19:11:49,168,stocks,NVDA

Tesla's New Self-Driving Ride-Hailing Service – A Game Changer?,"Hey everyone – just saw some big news. Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) is launching a self-driving ride-hailing service in Austin, TX. It’ll start with about 10 vehicles and scale up to 1,000 within a month. He also mentioned a goal of having 1 million fully autonomous vehicles in operation by the end of next year.

The service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb’s model.

TSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1–2%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla’s expansion into ride-hailing.

If you believe in the long-term potential of autonomous mobility and tech disruption, this might be a major growth driver for TSLA. Definitely something to keep an eye on.

(Bloomberg) — Chinese shipments of Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) iPhone and other mobile devices to the US dived to their lowest levels since 2011 in April, underscoring how the threat of US tariffs choked off the flow of big-ticket goods between the world’s two largest economies.

Smartphone exports slid 72% to just under $700 million last month, sharply outpacing an overall 21% drop in Chinese shipments to the US, detailed customs data showed on Tuesday. That highlighted the way the Trump administration’s tariffs campaign — peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods — is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.

Investors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.’s artificial intelligence chips.

Last year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.

The value of phone component exports to India — home to Apple’s biggest iPhone production base outside of China — roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.

Apple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home. The device has never been produced in the US, a project that appears unfeasible at least in the short run.",callsonreddit,2025-05-20 10:51:20,457,stocks,AAPL
"NVDA expects $15B loss in revenue due to ""deeply painful"" H20 Bans","Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-china-ai-d2cb34ee](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-china-ai-d2cb34ee)

  
Nvidia CEO Jensen Haung has quantified the revenue impact of the U.S. government’s latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion.



Last month, the administration effectively banned Nvidia’s H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements to the Asian country. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.

“This additional ban on Nvidia’s H20 is deeply painful,” Huang said in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. “We walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably—what is it? — $3 billion worth of taxes” for the U.S.

Critics have said offering Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence chips to China—even one or two generations old—can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.

A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.

The restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei’s AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei’s chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia’s current CUDA software advantage could erode.

“Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,” Huang said. “If we don’t compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we’re not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they’re not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.”

The executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia’s products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&D to compete with Nvidia.",thelastsubject123,2025-05-19 20:05:29,584,stocks,NVDA
What upcoming data/reports/events to watch out for that could impact the market?,"Could be good or bad. I’m thinking the market will continue trending slightly upwards until negative economic news/data really starts hitting. What I’m watching out for:

Negative:
1. “Liberation day 2” - if 50+ tariff announcements are made in 2-3 weeks
2. Pharmaceutical tariffs (maybe this week)
3. Semiconductor tariffs (maybe in June)
4. If empty store shelves occurs (if it happens probably in June)
5. If countries retaliate against tariffs: retaliatory tariffs (likely at some point), selling US debt like Japan (unlikely near term), halting US goods purchases (like China did with Boeing)
6. Enforcing sanctions against countries (China) getting oil from Iran
7. Effects of decreased tourism/consumers in foreign countries purchasing less American goods like Canadians/federal and private layoffs/loss of consumer spending and labor from deportations/tariff impacts 

Could swing either way
1. Pce report for April
2. June jobs/inflation/manufacturing reports
3. Q2 gdp report (which could indicate recession)
4. 90 day pause on reciprocal tariffs ending - does Trump extend or enact
5. NVDA earnings
6. Fed June meeting (unlikely to cut rates)
7. Fluctuation of value of the dollar

Positive:
1. Trade agreements/foreign countries agreeing to purchase additional US goods

News: [Trump Wants Apple To Stop Moving Iphone Production To India](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/trump-wants-apple-to-stop-moving-iphone-production-to-india)

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d) \- The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into UnitedHealth Group for ""potential Medicare fraud"" related to its Medicare Advantage business. The probe, active since at least last summer, is looking into ""questionable diagnoses"" to inflate payments from Medicare. UNH dropped close to 40 points yesterday afterhours. Not sure if it'll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news. This news is particularly bad because DOJ confirmed investigation is criminal. Other stocks such as HUM/CVS/CI have moved on this as well.

[**ETOR (eToro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ETOR&p=d) \- eToro's IPO priced at \~$68 per share, above the expected range of $46–$50, and the stock bounced off \~$65 off some strong bids. Mainly interested to see if the strong bids at $65 still exist (unlikely but I'll just keep an eye out anyway). Mainly a sector play in C-brokerages and the C-Market, since most of their income is derived from it. Beyond what I highlighted in the IPO analysis post, not interested in this long term. Probably will just trade as a proxy to the C-market in the future and I don't like the structure of their contract for diffs.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) \- Alibaba reported Q4 revenue of 236.45B yuan, a 7% increase year-over-year, but slightly below analyst expectations of 237.91B yuan. Income from operations nearly doubled to 28.47B yuan driven by improved efficiency and reduced share-based compensation. This has been on a decent run since April 8th (peak fear tariff selloffs). Watching $125 level. Alibaba's cloud division saw an 18% revenue increase, with AI-related product sales posting triple-digit growth.

[**FL (Foot Locker)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FL&p=d) \- Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) confirmed a $2.4B acquisition of Foot Locker at $24 per share, nearly double Foot Locker's previous closing price. Currently long and interested in seeing if we can converge even closer to $24, but overall don't see any other trade in this except for a reversal of news. Mainly integration challenges and potential antitrust concerns are the big risk, but unlikely with current admin.

"Saudi Arabia plans to spend billions of dollars on AI chips, U.S. to revoke Biden's chip restrictions, NVIDIA shares extend gains","Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.

Shares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.

NVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.

Bank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.

Nvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy “more than a million” of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.

U.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.

In a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: “For investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ”

“While we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.”

Investors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.

Additionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.

Previously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.

Shares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.

The artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.

The department also said that “the use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.” Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.

“Huawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),” Bernstein's Rasgon said.

“However, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,” he added. “This could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.”",twenson,2025-05-14 14:01:36,86,stocks,NVDA

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -> $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.

[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.

Stock awards made up about 73% of the CEOs’ pay package on the list.

"NVIDIA (NVDA) May 13, 2025","

Intraday Trend and Technical Patterns: May 12, 2025 (Monday) NVIDIA shares jumped 5.44% to close at $123.00

Driven by the positive news of the U.S.-China tariff truce, the stock fluctuated in the range of $120.28 to $123.00 on the day's trading session, and the closing price was the highest point of the day, approaching the immediate resistance level of $124.92

Technically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen to 87, indicating that the short-term is in overbought area and may face profit-taking pressure

The volume of the day is about 222 million shares, higher than the weekdays but slightly lower than the recent month's average of 283 million shares, indicating that the participation in this rally is moderate

The 50-day SMA is near $111.50, far below the current share price, verifying the recent strong upward momentum; while the 200-day SMA is about $125.04, slightly higher than yesterday's closing price, which is the highest point of the day. slightly above yesterday's close, implying that the stock is challenging long-term trend resistance

Key Support & Resistance: Technical support is currently around $114 The uptrend remains healthy if pullbacks don't break below this range

In the short term, the $125 neighborhood has become an important resistance level, corresponding to the 200-day SMA and the upper edge of the previous trading range

After opening on May 13, Nvidia shares continued to Nvidia's stock price continued to be strong, up about 2-3%, and at one point during the session broke through the $125 key resistance level (market capitalization). (market capitalization also close to $3 trillion)

The market expects that with the previous day's surge and high RSI, the stock may see a small increase after hitting the resistance level. Resistance may be followed by a small pullback or consolidation to absorb short-term profit-taking

If it manages to hold above $125, it is expected to turn that level into new support and set the stage for further upside; potential targets above include 52-week highs of 153.13

But continued gains need to be matched by positive fundamentals",Aluseda,2025-05-13 14:21:40,1,stocks,NVDA

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

I don't know how sustained today's move will be- we've made a massive move upwards, and even 30% tariffs will still reduce business with China by 70% in the medium term (\~6 to 9 month timeframe)

News: [Us And China Agree To Major Reductions In Tariffs For 90 Days](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/us-and-china-agree-to-major-reductions-in-tariffs-for-90-days)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d) **/** [**AMZN (Amazon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d)\- Both stocks are up \~6% following announcement of a 90-day suspension of U.S.-China tariffs, reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%. Watching $214/$215 in AAPL and seeing if we can make another move higher. Currently long. Obviously this is a 90-day suspension and not actually a guarantee that things will return back to normal. Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) **/** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\- Chinese tech stocks like BABA and JD are also major winners of tariffs, with both up roughly 6%, following the 90-day agreement. Watching $135 level (basically just seeing which Chinese stocks are close to breaking highs). Risks are the same as American stocks. Other notable stocks I like on this are BIDU/TCEHY (trades OTC)

[**PFE (Pfizer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d) **/** [**MRK (Merck)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRK&p=d) **/** [**JNJ (Johnson & Johnson)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JNJ&p=d)\- Trump announced plans to sign an executive order implementing a ""most-favored-nation"" policy to reduce U.S. prescription drug prices by up to 59%. This policy aims to ""align"" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).

[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids. BP is considered undervalued, with a market cap of £57B against asset valuations of \~£120B. No levels I'm watching at this time.

Got the biggest kick to my psyche's nuts in perhaps my entire life,"My mother recently passed and my dad is hanging on in memory care. I'm now running the family trust and so know all of my parent's holdings. Anyways I was going through copious amounts of files and yesterday finally took a closer look at a letter my dad wrote to us on 1/15/2007 before a trip they took up the Amazon, in case something bad happened I could start getting at the money. He provided a printout of all his stock and fund holdings and accounts and two positions really stood out. 

3100 shares of NFLX (~$70k)
1600 shares of NVDA. (~$56k)

We don't own either of those in the trust. Sold at some point perhaps years ago definitely before the extreme run-ups of the 2020's. Probably sold after making several hundred thousand or when they didn't move the right direction.

Today these holdings would be 

21,700 shares of NFLX at $1140 = $24.738 million
96,000 shares of NVDA at $116.65 = $11.198 million


Lesson is don't sell unless you absolutely have to and consider selling smaller chunks versus all or nothing.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

AMD mentioned a $1.5B revenue hit due to U.S. chip export restrictions to China, with $800M in costs linked to AI chip curbs. Overall pretty mixed results, stock spiked AH but gave back most of the gains, currently only up 1%. No particular level I'm watching. Overall I see less risk in this (and the other semis) now that most of the major chip companies (ARM reports today) have defined their losses due to the chip restriction- and we have clear defined numbers as to how much a stock will move if they're lifted. Obviously another bad catalyst would be completely stopping all exports, but that seems unlikely at this point.

Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)

Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level. SMCI's server business is essentially linked to AI/data center build-outs- but this stock hasn't been moving that much with tech companies announcing greater AI spend.

It seems like the market has collective amnesia about the upcoming semiconductor tariffs. How should we play this? I imagine the currently excluded product categories will be swept up under this new separate tariff regime, such as smartphones. 

Do we expect this to stack on top of other tariffs for categories that didn't receive exclusions from the retaliatory tariffs?

(05/5) Interesting Stocks Today - Federal Student Loan Payments Continue Today,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. 

News: [Trump Suggests Some Trade Deals Could Come As Early As This Week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/trump-suggests-some-trade-deals-could-come-as-early-as-this-week)

[**PLTR (Palantir)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\- We broke all-time highs today after a \~10 point move on Friday, driven largely by Trump's new defense spending proposal. Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. 

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).

Why I am extremely bullish,"I know this may contradict prevailing sentiment but I hope you can at least hear me out. I’ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I’m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META & SMH.

1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. 

2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. 


3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It’s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year’s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. 

4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. 

5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it’s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. 

6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",Jshbone12,2025-05-04 13:22:13,0,stocks,"MSFT,NVDA,AMZN"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Apple revenue tops Wall Street expectations but Services division disappoints,"Apple reported second fiscal-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company’s closely-watched Services division came up light versus estimates.  

Here’s how Apple did versus consensus estimates for the quarter ending in March: 

* EPS $1.65 vs. $1.63 estimated by LSEG 

* Revenue: $95.4 billion vs. $94.66 billion estimated by LSEG 

* iPhone revenue: $46.84 billion vs. $45.84 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Mac revenue: $7.95 billion vs. $7.77 billion estimated, per StreetAccount  

* iPad revenue: $6.4 billion vs. $6.20 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $7.52 billion vs. $7.95 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Services revenue: $26.65 billion vs. $26.70 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Gross margin: 41.7% vs. 47.1%, per StreetAccount 

The company reported $1.65 per share on $24.78 billion of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period. 

Apple typically provides data points about how it sees the current quarter shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is highly anticipating CEO Tim Cook’s first public comments on how Apple will navigate rapidly-shifting tariffs proposed by the Trump administration. 

Analysts are looking for third-quarter guidance of $1.48 in earnings per share on $89.45 billion of sales. 

Cook told CNBC that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than they are from China. Apple still makes the “vast majority” of its products for other countries from China, Cook said.  

“If you look at the U.S., over half of the U.S. sales of iPhone come from India,” Cook said. “If you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.” 

Cook said the iPhone uses a lot of chips made domestically, and that Apple is buying 19 billion chips this year from the U.S.  

“With an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,” he said.  

Apple said its board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases this quarter, down from $110 billion in authorization last year. Apple also said it would pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, a 4% increase. 

“We continue to plan for annual dividend increases,” Cook said.  

The company’s most important product line, iPhones, topped estimates at $46.8 billion in sales during the quarter. The overall product line’s sales were up just under 2% on an annual basis.  

Apple’s profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google.  

Cook, in a statement, hailed “double-digit” Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple’s services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter.  

Apple hardware generally did well during the quarter. 

Mac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March.  

However, Apple’s wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. 

Sales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates.  

On the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple’s largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order “pull forward” because of tariffs.  

“We don’t believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,” Cook said. “There’s no obvious evidence of it.”

"Electric vehicles, solar panels, and humanoid worker robots...and the WINNER IS...","I say Tesla (TSLA) has an upside of 1000% over the next 5-10 years. First Musk will perfect his robots in Tesla plants, and then he will replace the vast majority of Tesla auto factory workers with robots. Tesla's EV's will be the hands-down cheapest and best American electric vehicles, due to greatly reduced labor costs. Maybe Tesla cars won't sell well for a while, you say, because ""everyone hates Musk"". That's ok, with whatever Tesla vehicles don't sell, Musk will simply deploy them all as massive fleets of electric self-driving robotaxis that start undercutting Uber and Lyft all over America. There will soon be an energy crisis due to mass proliferation of AI GPU's, and electric vehicles. The fastest easiest solution to increase energy production incrementally is guess what...? SOLAR.  So then Tesla will make a killing by selling its state-of-the-art solar panels, and Chinese solar panels won't be able to compete in America, thanks to Trump tariffs. If skyrocketing silver prices becomes an issue, Musk will simply buy some silver mines like he said he might. Meantime, the Big-3 American Auto makers will be forced to replace their workforce with robots from Tesla, in order to lower their vehicle prices to compete with the cheaper and superior Tesla autos. Or maybe the Big-3 won't abandon UAW, and they'll all sink together. Either way Tesla wins. Musk will make sure worker robots are sold gradually in a strategic fashion, determining the Winners \[those who are allowed to purchase worker robots first, before competitors are allowed\] and Losers \[those who aren't allowed (or don't want to) purchase robots, and are forced to stick with American human labor\].",CrazyAspie88,2025-05-01 18:30:07,0,stocks,TSLA

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Tesla chair denied reports of a search for a new CEO to replace Elon Musk, reaffirming the company’s commitment to its current leadership structure. This news initially broke overnight yesterday and the stock saw a 6 point drop. I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well.

[**RBLX (Roblox)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\- Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected. Raised 2025 bookings guidance to $5.285B–$5.36B, above analyst consensus of $5.27B. Interested in $74 level, other than that not too interested in the stock. No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc). Buy your kids some Robux!

[**MSFT (Microsoft)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&p=d)\- EPS of $3.46 vs. $3.22 expected and revenue of $70.07B vs. $68.42B expected. Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). 

[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\- Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B–$45.5B. Increased 2025 capex forecast to $64B–$72B, citing heightened infrastructure and AI investments. Also a huge mover, interested in it if it breaks the $600 level.

"Inheriting a small fortune, considering how to invest it until 2029 in the current climate","This is probably an extremely tired topic, but wanted some advice, or at least some personal stories from people who have had experience in the market.

When the 2020 pandemic crash happened, I was 21 and had some money, so I started looking into investing. I was a complete rookie and an idiot, thinking that I was good at choosing companies when it was just a ridiculous bull market, and after coming out on a small plus side, I let go of the market for a very long time.

In February of this year, my father suddenly passed away. As we were going through his accounts and our family assets, we realized he was quite good with money, and alongside his monthly pension that will be given to my mother, we learned that we were going to be well off. After careful calculation, my mother decided to keep the pension, and one third of my father's assets. I was given around two thirds of the assets, which came out to roughly 280,000$.

I'm from Korea, and for my entire life, always dreamed of moving to the States for a high paying job, but never had the money to get the education in order to do so. Now I do.

After crunching the numbers, I've decided to put aside 80,000$ to pay for my living costs, tuition costs to prepare for my education in the States, and for some traveling. This will keep me fairly comfortable until the end of 2028. Which leaves 200,000$ for me to invest in, in order to build up my net worth for my time studying in America, before finally getting a job.

Then Trump announced the tariffs, and I started to reconsider everything.

Thankfully, I was mostly cash when the market went down, and afterwards I had invested  up to 50,000$ back into the market. Mostly focusing on either dividend heavy companies or ETF's like VOO, SCHD, KO, PEPCO, and powerhouse tech companies like NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, and other sectors, as well as companies in other countries.

My issue now is whether to wait for the doom mindset that so many people seem to have about the current US administration and the market to take full effect and tank everything, or do I just DCA into the company roster that I made for the next few months, and just let the market do its thing for the next 3 to 4 years. I know that timing the market is stupid, and even if you time it perfectly, it's so stressful anyways. I kinda just want to invest and not think about it constantly.

I woud love to hear your long-term investing stories to settle my mind. Been very anxious about all of this in the last month or so.",ishouldgooutmore,2025-05-01 06:38:50,1,stocks,"MSFT,NVDA,AMZN"
How can I lock in profits on a short put as the stock approaches the strike price?,"I sold a put option on MSFT with a $435 strike, expiring in August. The stock is now about to cross $435, and I’m unsure whether it will stay above that level by expiration.

Once MSFT trades above $435, the put will still have some extrinsic value left. Is there a way for me to extract that value now — so that even if MSFT drops below $435 before August, I’ll have already locked in my profit? I dont want to loose the extrinsic value
